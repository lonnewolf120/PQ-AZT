This short progress report summarizes the recent work to analyze and modify the packet/flow CSV dataset so it can be used for Quantum Machine Learning (QML) experiments. The goal was to inspect the corpus, propose useful QML-ready features, implement an augmentation tool, and validate it on a small subset of the data.

What I did

1. Quick dataset inspection
- Enumerated CSV files under `dataset/` and sampled the first few rows from each file to confirm schema consistency.
- Observed a common numeric header across most files: flow statistics (Rate, AVG, Std, Tot sum, Tot size, Number, Variance, IAT) plus many protocol/service indicator columns (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, LLC, etc.).

2. Designed QML-friendly feature set
- Chosen features were deliberately small in number, numeric, and amenable to amplitude/angle encodings used in QML:
  - coeff_var_Number: coefficient of variation for per-flow packet counts (Std / AVG)
  - log_TotSize: log1p of Tot size to reduce heavy skew
  - flow_entropy: approximate per-row entropy computed from protocol/service indicator columns
  - rate_normalized: Rate normalized by a global StandardScaler
  - pca_1, pca_2: first two PCA components fit on a sampled subset of numeric features
  - angle encodings: sin/cos encodings of Rate and log_TotSize to produce angle pairs for circuit feature maps

3. Implemented augmentation tool
- Added `tools/augment_for_qml.py` which:
  - Samples rows across files to fit a global StandardScaler and a PCA (to avoid loading the whole corpus into memory).
  - Computes the new features per-row and writes augmented CSVs under `dataset_augmented/`, preserving folder structure.
  - Supports a `--limit-files` option to operate on a small subset for validation and a `--train-split` option to write per-file train/test splits (file.csv and file_test.csv when there are enough rows).
- Implemented robustness measures: NaN/inf sanitization, clipping extreme values, and fallbacks when expected columns are missing.

4. Validation run (small-sample)
- Executed the tool limited to 5 files with `--sample-per-file 100` and `--train-split 0.7`.
- The tool completed, producing augmented train and test CSVs under `dataset_augmented/`.
- Verified new columns are present (coeff_var_Number, log_TotSize, flow_entropy, rate_normalized, pca_1, pca_2, rate_sin, rate_cos, logTot_sin, logTot_cos) by previewing the first 10 rows of one augmented file.

Issues encountered and fixes

- Path resolution error: the initial attempt to write outputs used a relative resolution that failed when mixing relative and absolute paths. Fix: resolve both dataset root and input paths with `Path.resolve()` and fall back to using just the filename when necessary.

- Numerical instability: during scaling/PCA the scaler sometimes received inf or extremely large values and raised errors. Fix: sanitize numeric arrays with `np.nan_to_num`, clip extreme values, and guard PCA/scaler usage.

- Angle encoding divide warnings: dividing by a max value of zero produced warnings. Fix: sanitize inputs and ensure max_val > 0 by defaulting to 1.0.

What changed in the repository

- Modified `tools/augment_for_qml.py` — added angle encodings, per-file train/test split, --limit-files and sanitization improvements.
- Created augmented outputs under `dataset_augmented/` for the sample run.

How to reproduce locally

1. Activate your Python virtual environment (PowerShell example):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements_qml.txt
```

2. Run the augmentation on a small sample (first 5 files):

```powershell
python .\tools\augment_for_qml.py --dataset .\dataset --out .\dataset_augmented --limit-files 5 --sample-per-file 100 --train-split 0.7
```

3. Inspect outputs under `dataset_augmented/`.

Requirements coverage (mapping to user asks)

- "Analyze the dataset and inspect first 2-5 rows": Done — I sampled rows across CSVs and confirmed header consistency.
- "Add minimum 4-5 columns for QML models": Done — added 8 new columns (see list above), including angle encodings suitable for QML feature maps.
- "Run script on a small sample and show example augmented CSV": Done — ran on 5 files and previewed an augmented CSV.
- "Extend script to include angle encodings and per-file train/test splits": Done — both added and validated.

Next steps (suggested)

- Create a manifest CSV listing each augmented file and its class label (derive label from parent folder). This makes downstream dataset loading simpler.
- Optionally run the augmentation across the full dataset — this will take a while; I can do it and report progress if you want.
- Add a small unit test or smoke test that asserts the presence and types of new columns for a few example files.

Concluding notes

The augmentation tool now produces a compact, QML-friendly feature set and can be run in sample mode for quick validation. I addressed path and numerical issues encountered during the first runs. If you'd like, I can now:
- generate the manifest with labels, or
- run the full augmentation, or
- add configurable feature-selection for angle encoding.
